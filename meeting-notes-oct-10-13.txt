================================================================================
MEETING: Product Page Review with Austin & Joe (Oct 13, 3:00 PM EDT)
================================================================================

ATTENDEES:
- Gavin McNamara
- Austin Clare (austin@strivesoda.com) - Head of Sales
- Joseph Perry - Strive ECOM team

MEETING SUMMARY:
Focused meeting on product page conversion optimization based on previous site performance data.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Old Shopify site (pre-redesign): Converted ~800 customers, wasn't perfect but worked
- Chris's redesign: Performance dropped significantly ("went to s***")
- Austin & Joe optimized product pages 5 months ago → 800 conversions on Meta
- Current new design not converting as well as old version
- GOAL: Keep what works from new design + restore what worked from old design

AUSTIN & JOE'S PRODUCT PAGE REQUIREMENTS (PRIORITY 0):

1. **REMOVE ALL SECTIONS THAT NAVIGATE AWAY**
   - "Why Organic Honey" → Move to science page
   - "Why Not Synthetic Sugars" → Remove entirely
   - "Honey vs Other Sweeteners" → Rename to "STRIVE VS EVERYONE" (keep on product page)
   - NO LINKS that take users off product page
   - Users must get ALL information on product page itself
   - Exception: Other pages (Science, About Us) can have external links

2. **IMAGERY - MAKE IT BIGGER** (Top Priority)
   - Main product image should take up almost ENTIRE first fold
   - Carousel of images directly underneath main image
   - Should be: Image → Carousel → Add to Cart (minimal scroll)
   - Current imagery too small - can't see details
   - Need lifestyle images of PEOPLE being active
   - Add collage of lifestyle images somewhere on page
   - Use old theme's lifestyle images (need to retrieve)

3. **"WHY CHOOSE STRIVE" SECTION**
   - This section is "10 out of 10" - KEEP IT
   - Should be prominent on product page
   - This is the best-performing content

4. **"WHEN TO DRINK STRIVE" SECTION**
   - Needs work from conversion standpoint
   - Shorter copy needed
   - MORE LIFESTYLE IMAGES (less text)
   - Images of people being active with Strive

5. **LABEL VISIBILITY** (Biggest Customer Service Issue)
   - Current header is "ugly" and label not apparent
   - Create dedicated section: "What's in Strive" or "Deep Dive into Label"
   - Make label easy to find and read
   - This is causing most customer service inquiries

6. **MOBILE HEADER**
   - Logo display needs updating
   - Fix mobile header layout issues

7. **WIDGET & SUBSCRIPTION**
   - Widget placement is fine
   - Keep subscribe & save functionality

8. **FUTURE CONSIDERATION (Not P0)**
   - Product navigation: ability to switch between products (Tropical → Peach → Variety) without going back to shop page
   - Not priority but would improve UX

AUSTIN'S PHILOSOPHY:
- "We're spending money to get them to that page"
- Giving users option to leave product page = losing conversions
- See → Click → Buy → Get all info on product page
- No navigation away until purchase complete

TIMELINE:
- Austin: "Should take you more than like 20 minutes" (because components already built)
- Focus: Product pages ONLY for this round
- Everything else on site is "amazing" - no changes needed

FUTURE PLANS:
- Competitor analysis in D2C space
- Sandbox site testing for new concepts
- Continuous optimization based on conversion data

SITE HISTORY CONTEXT:
- ~800 customers converted on previous optimized site
- New redesign killed conversions
- Austin & Joe's changes 5 months ago restored performance
- Current goal: Restore that conversion rate with new design elements

KEY QUOTE:
"The new product pages didn't convert. The old ones did. Let's just go back to [what worked]."
