## Brand Hierarchy (CRITICAL - Must Follow)

Chris outlined the **exact** messaging hierarchy for Strive Soda:

### The 1-2-3 Formula (Explain Like Fourth Graders)

**1. It's a SODA**
- Category: Soda occasion
- Not a sports drink, not a functional beverage - it's a SODA first

**2. Better-for-you = HYDRATION**
- What makes it better? Hydration element
- Powered by ELECTROLYTES
- "Everybody knows what hydration means on a fundamental level"
- "More endurance sports athletes than there's ever been on planet Earth before"
- Marry "hydration" + "electrolytes" = unique, sexy selling point

**3. Sweetened with ORGANIC WILDFLOWER HONEY**
- Every soda needs sweetness to boost flavor
- Ours comes from organic wildflower honey
- Not sugar, not artificial - honey

**Chris's exact words:** _"When you're thinking about everything, hierarchy of information is: soda, hydration, sweetened comes from organic honey 100%."_

---

## Website Feedback

### ✅ What Chris LOVED

**Homepage:**
- "Night and day different than what we had before"
- Educational layout and content flow
- "What is the hydration soda" section (though needs hierarchy update)
- Overall macro design and bones are solid

**Science Page:**
- Hydration education section: "75% of adults are chronically dehydrated - what's the cure? Beautiful. I love this."
- Flow from hydration → "why honey?" is on point
- Macro approach is correct

**Product Pages:**
- Subscribe & Save automatically selected: "That's absolutely the way it should work"
- Thinks from sales standpoint - website needs to transact
- Nutrition Facts label: "Great to keep building upon"

**Overall:**
- "180 degrees better than what it was before"
- "These are great bones. I think a lot of the macro things are there."
- "We could iterate and perfect and design until the cows come home"

### 🐛 Issues Identified (Priority Fixes)

#### **P0 - URGENT (Before Next Meeting)**

1. **Header Responsive Issue** ⚠️
   - **Problem:** On MacBook Pro (not fully expanded), "About Us" menu item gets cut off
   - **Location:** Header navigation menu
   - **Fix:** Responsive design adjustment for medium-sized screens
   - **Chris:** "There's just a bit of a width thing going on right there"

2. **Hero Section Text Cutoff** ⚠️
   - **Problem:** "Meet the Soda" text gets cut off unless browser is fully expanded rail-to-rail
   - **Location:** Homepage top fold / hero section
   - **Fix:** Responsive text sizing or container width adjustment

3. **Move FAQ from Header to Footer** ⚠️
   - **Problem:** FAQ clutters header, doesn't support purchase focus
   - **Location:** Header navigation → Footer navigation
   - **Chris:** "FAQ could probably go to footer just to keep the header simple and focus on purchase"
   - **Also:** Maybe add FAQ link within Science page

#### **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY (This Week)**

4. **Homepage 1-2-3 Section - Update to Match Hierarchy**
   - **Problem:** Current section shows hydration details, but doesn't match brand hierarchy
   - **Location:** Homepage "What is a hydration soda?" section
   - **Fix:** Update to "fourth grade level" explanation:
     - **#1:** It's a SODA (category/occasion)
     - **#2:** Better-for-you = HYDRATION (electrolytes)
     - **#3:** Sweetened with ORGANIC WILDFLOWER HONEY
   - **Reference:** Look at Spirited Hive's "Ready to Enjoy" → "Premium Spirits" → "Sweetened with Honey" layout

5. **"Why Honey?" Section Background Color**
   - **Problem:** White background doesn't match brand aesthetic
   - **Location:** Science page "Why Honey?" section
   - **Fix:** Change to Tiffany Blue (#0ABAB5) or tannish color
   - **Gavin:** "I don't like how it's the white background"

6. **Science Page Opening Text - Match Hierarchy**
   - **Problem:** Current text says "new category of sparkling beverage designed to do more than just quench your thirst"
   - **Location:** Science page opening paragraph
   - **Fix:** Call out hierarchy (soda → hydration → honey) more clearly

7. **CTA Consolidation**
   - **Problem:** Duplicate CTAs on some pages look "funky"
   - **Location:** Multiple pages (Science page has 2 CTAs at bottom)
   - **Fix:** Remove duplicates, keep one consistent CTA per section
   - **Make consistent:** All CTAs should either go to "Shop Flavors" or specific product

#### **P2 - NICE TO HAVE (Next Sprint)**

8. **FAQ Page Styling**
   - **Current:** "Plain Jane" but functional accordion layout
   - **Future:** Make sexy after content is finalized
   - **Chris:** "We got the content first and then we can make it sexy later"

9. **About Us Page Imagery**
   - **Current:** Placeholder image of Jack (unknown if he likes it)
   - **Future:** Replace with approved founder photo, mission imagery
   - **Note:** Checkered board layout approved, but needs polish

10. **Product Page Gallery**
    - **Current:** No new images added yet
    - **Future:** Integrate professional studio photography (coming next week)
    - **Note:** Wait for photography album before making changes

---

## Photography & Content Coming

### Studio Photography (Next Week)

**What's Coming:**
- ✅ Professional product photography (June Shine quality level)
- ✅ Studio shoot completed last week - photos delivered early next week
- ✅ Another full day of studio shoots planned
- ✅ Will replace AI-generated placeholder images

**Chris's Instructions:**
1. Receive photography album early next week
2. "Go crazy with it" - integrate into site
3. Provide feedback on what's **missing** for web
4. Next studio shoot will be more web-focused based on feedback

**What to Request for Next Shoot:**
- Science-focused visuals (electrolytes, salt, elements)
- "Really interesting and sexy photos of the science behind Strive"
- Design-stage imagery that makes site better than June Shine
- More sophisticated web-specific shots

**Chris's Take on AI Images:**
- "100% considered a placeholder"
- "So hard to build a website without any imagery"
- "The fact that you can get it halfway there and I can get you the other half - we can replace stuff over time"

---

## Future Partnership Structure (CONFIRMED)

### What Chris Wants

**Model:** Maintenance Retainer + Project Sprints

**Maintenance Retainer:**

**Additional Opportunities:**
- ✅ Graphic design work (ad hoc projects)
- ✅ Mock-ups for campaigns
- ✅ Two brands: **Strive Soda + Spirited Hive**
- ✅ "There's a lot of work to be done. There's no lack of work."

**Chris's Leadership:**
- Jack will "hand it off to me pretty soon"
- Chris will handle: design, copy, messaging, look and feel
- Focus: "Product page standpoint that it has to transact"
- Understands DTC/e-commerce fundamentals
