The Science Behind Hydration Soda

===========================================
INTRO SECTION
===========================================
Most people walk around slightly dehydrated throughout the day without realizing it—even before a workout or a long day at the office. Strive Soda was created to deliver hydration, clean sweetness, and bold flavor in a sparkling beverage you can enjoy anytime.

Fun Fact: Studies show that over 75% of adults are chronically dehydrated, often without noticeable symptoms. Strive Soda helps you stay balanced while enjoying soda you actually want to drink.

===========================================
WHAT IS A HYDRATION SODA?
===========================================
Hydration soda is a new category of sparkling beverage designed to do more than just quench your thirst:

SUPPORTS HYDRATION
Each can of Strive contains 180mg of electrolytes:

• Sodium (100mg): Maintains fluid balance and supports muscle function
• Magnesium (30mg): Aids energy production and muscle relaxation
• Potassium (30mg): Supports heart function and proper cell signaling
• Calcium (20mg): Supports healthy muscle function and bone health

Strive's 180mg of electrolytes per can helps your body replenish what you lose naturally throughout your day while enjoying delicious flavor. This is the perfect amount to help your body stay balanced throughout the day (roughly 1/3 the electrolytes of a typical sports drink).

WHEN TO DRINK:
• Swap Strive for your afternoon soda—get flavor and hydration without the crash
• Post-workout, post-yoga, or post-run for a refreshing lift
• During long workdays to stay sharp and hydrated

===========================================
WHY HONEY?
===========================================
We use organic wildflower honey because it's the perfect natural and organic sweetener:

• Delivers just the right amount of sweetness without synthetic ingredients
• Provides antioxidants, trace vitamins, and minerals for subtle nutritional support
• Supports steady hydration and refreshment without the sugar spike or crash

HONEY FACTS:
• Rich in antioxidants, including flavonoids and phenolic acids
• Contains small amounts of vitamins and minerals like B vitamins, calcium, magnesium, and potassium
• Provides natural, clean sweetness without artificial additives

===========================================
WHY NOT SYNTHETIC SUGARS OR HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP?
===========================================
Many sodas and energy drinks rely on artificial sweeteners or HFCS, which can:

• Contribute to blood sugar spikes and crashes
• Lack nutritional benefits (no vitamins, minerals, or antioxidants)
• Contain synthetic chemicals like sucralose, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium
• Increase empty calorie consumption without any functional benefits
• Potential Health Risks: Some studies suggest long-term exposure to synthetic sweeteners may be potentially cancer-causing, disrupt gut microbiota, and affect metabolism

Strive Soda avoids these ingredients entirely, relying on organic honey for natural sweetness and functional hydration.

===========================================
STEVIA - WHY WE AVOID IT
===========================================
Aftertaste / Bitter Flavor:
Many people notice a bitter, licorice-like, or metallic aftertaste with stevia, especially in higher concentrations. This can affect the taste of beverages and foods.

Digestive Issues:
Some individuals may experience bloating, gas, or diarrhea, particularly when consuming stevia in larger amounts or in combination with sugar alcohols.

Blood Sugar Effects (Variable):
While generally considered safe for people with diabetes, some studies suggest that stevia may still impact insulin sensitivity or blood glucose regulation in certain individuals, though effects are usually mild.

Processed Forms / Additives:
Many commercially available stevia products are highly processed and combined with fillers or sugar alcohols (like erythritol or maltodextrin), which can reduce the "natural" appeal and sometimes cause digestive discomfort.
