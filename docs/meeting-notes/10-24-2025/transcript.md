### Opening (00:00 - 00:08)

**Jack Espy:** [00:01] I like it. [00:02] I will survive.
Gavin McNamara: [00:04] I will strive.
Jack Espy: [00:06] How are you doing?
Gavin McNamara: [00:08] Doing great, man. [00:10] Yeah. [00:10] Good Friday so far. [00:12] Synced up with the. [00:16] With my intern, which I feel weird to keep calling him that, to be honest, but that's what he is to make some updates to our. [00:25] Our website and. [00:30] Dude, yeah, just like, like, ready to like, rumble and like, dive into, you know, this, these beautiful projects that we have coming up and, you know, polishing up the. [00:43] This drive site. [00:44] And I was just finishing up at a deadline for a customer on for today. [00:51] Actually, between you and me, a little. [00:55] He's like a like 65 year old that's like trying to get into the AI space. [01:01] And he's like, he's like, gav, like, can you like, add music to like, the site? [01:08] And I'm like, like, MySpace. [01:10] It's like. [01:11] He's like, kinda. [01:13] And I'm like, who can? [01:15] But like, it's not gonna, like, it's gonna cost more to do that.
Jack Espy: [01:20] I. [01:20] I hate music on sites, dude.
Gavin McNamara: [01:23] Me too.
Jack Espy: [01:24] Because then it's like you open it, you open it up at a coffee shop and it's like, screw that.
Gavin McNamara: [01:31] I'm like, you know, I tried to give him my, my input in regards to, like, all right, like, this is how we should build out the site. [01:38] And he's got his own vision and so, yeah, almost done with him, which is nice, but a lot of. [01:46] A lot of lessons learned there, which is always good to take from.
Jack Espy: [01:52] Well, heck, yeah. [01:52] Well, I'm thinking on for this call today. [01:56] How do you want to handle this?
Gavin McNamara: [01:58] Yeah, so, like, I think that the best way to do it is like, I have everything, like, teed up for the updates that we want to make on site for Strive. [02:13] And so, like, I wouldn't want to hold you up and like, like, go through those particular pieces just yet because over the weekend I'm going to need to. [02:25] To focus on like, pivoting and working on it. [02:30] But then I think we can talk about, yeah, like, anything that's we wanted, like, in regards to like, Hive and you know, moving forward, like, maybe however we want to jam, we jam.
Jack Espy: [02:46] Yeah, I'm thinking, because I'm still trying to figure out like, so we have someone right now that's helping us with design stuff, but she takes a really long time and like, a lot of the stuff we need, like, You know, within like a couple of days. [03:02] And then obviously I think somewhere would. [03:05] We would need you is just like maintenance on the sites, on both sites. [03:10] So I think that's kind of where we'd want to be. [03:12] And I don't know what that is. [03:13] Maybe like we'd start with hours and then we can always move towards like retainer stuff in the future. [03:22] Yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking. [03:24] And yeah, I'm thinking, I mean, because also too, like, because the one thing we're waiting on so like the strive side, I know you, you got a lot of like edits and stuff like that you need to make over the weekend. [03:35] And then just on the high side, we can almost get started on that because like we're just waiting for the videos to come in and we just pop those in there. [03:49] Like there's nothing, you know, it's just make the vodka crayon side super holiday themed.
Gavin McNamara: [03:55] Absolutely.
Jack Espy: [03:57] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [03:57] Add in the, like, the, like the different reviews, you know, we can play around with.
Jack Espy: [04:03] That's gonna be hilarious, dude.
Gavin McNamara: [04:05] Absolutely. [04:06] Like, I, I love the way that Chris was thinking about it and he's like one star from the Grinch. [04:12] Yeah. [04:13] I'm like, my knee jerk reaction was like, like, I don't know. [04:17] But like, I think that is just a really smart marketing tactic that like, I'm. [04:22] I don't know about, but I know that like I would be as a customer, I'd be like, that's funny.
Jack Espy: [04:28] You know? [04:29] Yeah. [04:29] I think. [04:32] Do you know what we could do? [04:33] We could almost do two things. [04:34] Like Grinch has one star and he goes, I had too many. [04:39] Yeah. [04:39] And then a couple like reviews later, he. [04:44] He gives a five stars and he said he. [04:46] It made my heart five times bigger because now how his heart grows at the end.
Gavin McNamara: [04:51] I love it. [04:54] Just like, scratch that. [04:55] Yeah, yeah, that would be. [04:58] That would be. [04:59] Yeah, that's genius. [05:00] And so like, what we can do there is like, I think what you guys have given me and like the action items and the priority like all. [05:13] All is there. [05:14] Right? [05:14] Like all makes sense. [05:17] And so like, I don't want to have to like, dude, I know that you're super busy and like you're traveling and so I don't want to take up unnecessary time, but I want to make sure that, you know, like, this is what I'm prioritizing like going into this weekend and next week, like that deadline for 11:1. [05:38] Like.
Jack Espy: [05:39] Yeah, you know. [05:41] Yeah. [05:41] I think, I think for us is like, obviously all the edits that we discuss on strive. [05:46] Like, let's iron those ones out. [05:48] Because the one thing I'm not sure if I'm in love with the 1, 2, 3 of hydration soda. [05:56] I think I love the idea of it, but just like the way it's laid out right now.
Gavin McNamara: [06:00] Dude, 100.
Jack Espy: [06:02] But yeah, I think. [06:03] Oh yeah, like all those edits that you're making, like we'll. [06:08] Those ones will do those first. [06:10] And then obviously like the about us and the creating the GEO locator for strive. [06:18] Like we can wait on that then. [06:21] You know, I can make some time with you next week to I think if you maybe take a first pass at the vodka page to make that kind of like really fun. [06:33] Because all I'm thinking here, let me share my screen.
Gavin McNamara: [06:36] Yeah. [06:38] And also, sorry. [06:39] With the. [06:39] The stripe piece. [06:40] I. [06:40] The 1, 2, 3. [06:42] That's like me mid like building and I'm not in love with it too. [06:46] It's more of a. [06:47] Like I was like building out the section. [06:50] But yeah.
Jack Espy: [06:52] So I think here on this page. [06:55] Right. [06:55] Just this part right here. [06:57] So just this top fold. [06:58] Yep. [06:59] That hero section, very like holiday themed. [07:02] And then it can be like find your hive or like maybe like something clever around like the holidays. [07:17] Find your like some. [07:24] We'll. [07:25] We'll figure out something. [07:26] But then you click on this instead of it bringing you here. [07:29] Yeah. [07:30] It'll bring you straight to this page and then this will be all holiday themed, all decked out. [07:40] And I think this like here, let me. [07:46] Let me see if I can judge this up.
Gavin McNamara: [07:50] Oh yeah. [08:08] And also what I'll do with the. [08:10] Like this and even the landing page, I can essentially just duplicate the pages and then pied one of them like the one that we have now and then we could turn it back on afterwards.
Jack Espy: [08:24] Exactly. [08:25] Yeah. [08:38] Why is my freaking chat GPT.
Gavin McNamara: [08:47] The giving you. [08:49] Giving you some crap.
Jack Espy: [08:51] Yeah, we might need to use yours. [08:52] Yours is like dang, dang. [08:54] Mine's like freaking got an extra chromosome over here, dude. [09:01] Here, I just put this like what we could just throw in. [09:03] In the chat box.
Gavin McNamara: [09:05] Let's f****** do it. [09:07] Let me. [09:09] Dude, you got. [09:10] So you have a Mac, right?
Jack Espy: [09:12] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [09:13] You got to download the new chat GPT web browser.
Jack Espy: [09:19] Let me.
Gavin McNamara: [09:21] Dude, it's. [09:23] It's game changing for me. [09:26] Like I'm like a little nutty with tech obviously. [09:31] And like I just go for like trying to break but. [09:39] Oh yeah, I'll show you. [09:40] I'll show you in a second. [09:43] May not be able to record the contents. [09:46] Okay, let's see. [09:47] I think I'm able to share entire screen actually. [09:56] Sorry, give me one sec. [10:03] Okay, so let's go into. [10:13] Okay, how about this? [10:14] Ready? [10:27] All right, so what are we. [10:33] So I'm going to paste this in and I'm going to go to shop. [10:42] Shop drinks.
Jack Espy: [10:43] Yeah, that one.
Gavin McNamara: [10:46] I'm just gonna say we're making a full holiday themed version of this page in particular. [10:56] And so it's going to be all about the, you know, the vodka cranberry. [11:01] And I want you to take a shot at updating the description, you know, with the text above and keeping in mind the holiday Christmas and like what this page will look like with the sexy updates. [11:22] Ready for this? [11:24] This is hot. [11:31] Can you see. [11:32] See my screen right now? [11:34] Yeah, dude, it's literally it's going through and like visualizing the entire site that I'm on right now. [11:43] Like the page.
Jack Espy: [11:46] Dude, what the. [11:49] Yeah, it's insane. [11:50] I think, I think AI, I know you that you live AI, but AI is freaking me out. [11:56] Like I feel like in even the past couple of weeks it's gone like insane.
Gavin McNamara: [12:01] Dude. [12:01] So there has been this thing about AI that. [12:07] And essentially, it's breaking what was the Fibonacci theorem. [12:12] And the Fibonacci theorem was like, all right, every certain amount of time, whatever it is, doubles and its abilities. [12:24] So I think it starts with 1, then 3, then an 8, 16. [12:30] And, like, it's an infinite doubling. [12:34] And, like, the theory is, like, every 90 days, AI was predicted to double in its abilities. [12:43] First started at six months in 90 days now, but it's. [12:48] It's reducing its time be, like, faster than the Fibonacci. [12:51] So it's reversing it and, like, now getting updates that are so incredible in its abilities in days. [13:01] And soon enough is going to be a day, and soon enough, it's going to be hours, minutes, and, like, I'm talking, like, doubling its abilities.
Jack Espy: [13:10] That's insane. [13:12] Yeah, it's scary, but, like, okay, I thought it was gonna update it on the actual site.
Gavin McNamara: [13:17] Like, that would. [13:18] Oh, no, it could. [13:21] Technically could, but it definitely could if we're in Shopify. [13:29] But what it's doing right now is just making sure it has the understanding of the site after a long day. [13:36] Okay, so let's take a look at this puppy. [14:00] Obviously, we want to get rid of any of these AI Dashes, but what's your initial thoughts?
Jack Espy: [14:08] I like it. [14:08] I think it's kind of funny.
Gavin McNamara: [14:10] Do you want to speak into it and give it an iteration?
Jack Espy: [14:20] I think, okay, yeah, I'll speak to it.
Gavin McNamara: [14:33] All right. [14:34] Three, two, one.
Jack Espy: [14:38] This is great. [14:40] Add a little bit more humor to it and make it a little bit shorter, since it needs to be a description, but, you know, not too much shorter.
Gavin McNamara: [14:52] I love it. [14:54] It's exactly how I would go about it. [15:00] And so. [15:00] One other thing too with this update. [15:04] So I went into like my Google Ads and since when you give it access to something so like LinkedIn, Facebook, it will go and act as you through those things, those portals and it will take action. [15:17] And so yesterday I like looked at my Google Ads and it was like oh, your ads are like, you know, at like, like a medium level. [15:25] And I'm like, before I went to sleep, I'm like, take action, go through my campaign and like make it excellent. [15:33] And I woke up and it literally updated my entire campaign. [15:38] Excellent.
Jack Espy: [15:39] Yeah, this one's frickin perfect. [15:44] I love this. [15:45] And what I'm thinking we could do for the images, like obviously we'll get rid of the three images on the right. [15:51] We'll have obviously can, but and make both those main images like of the can and the carton obviously shows up to be holiday. [16:01] Maybe like them sitting underneath like this photo, that one right there underneath a tree or something. [16:08] And then I like that like lights around it. [16:12] And then what I'm thinking is the other three we could use AI to where it's like Santa has one with Mrs. [16:18] Claus and then we can have one of like the deers, the reindeers holding them and one of the reindeers saying yo, Rudolph, you try this yet?
Gavin McNamara: [16:30] I love it, love it. [16:36] And oh, dude, also I was just thinking too like one we could take a shot at an iteration where it's like, it's the like the ornaments on a Christmas tree.
Jack Espy: [16:47] Yeah, that would be cool. [16:49] I love. [16:49] Do you know we've actually done that before at our house. [16:52] We'll finish cans and put a little thing on it and put them on the tree.
Gavin McNamara: [16:56] Dude, that's awesome. [16:59] Yeah, it would be funny if they have one with like. [17:02] Nah, maybe it wouldn't be that funny. [17:04] I was gonna say Santa in his sleigh.
Jack Espy: [17:07] Yeah, maybe not Santa in a sleigh, but I mean we could maybe do some like. [17:11] And then we could use those for social media. [17:13] We could post those.
Gavin McNamara: [17:14] Dude, a hundred percent. [17:16] Yeah, we can even make videos from those. [17:20] All right. [17:20] Like little like seven second clips, you know, all that jazz. [17:27] Okay, so we're gonna save this. [17:30] Yeah. [17:32] All right. [17:33] So actually it's literally this is embedded into chat gbt. [17:38] So like it is like my chat. [17:44] It's right here actually. [17:48] I don't have one for a project for stride for Hive. [18:07] And what this does is everything that talk about that. [18:11] Is that the right one? [18:16] That is spirited Hive related. [18:19] It will essentially uses that project as its ground truth for like all the information.
Jack Espy: [18:25] Oh, heck yeah. [18:27] Do you think we could utilize why not us to do one of those photos or like one of those renders?
Gavin McNamara: [18:34] Of course, my friend. [18:38] Let's go. [18:50] Let's see.
Jack Espy: [18:51] What's your email?
Gavin McNamara: [18:53] My. [18:53] My email? [18:54] Yeah, it's Gavin. [18:57] Why not us? [18:58] AI.
Jack Espy: [19:01] Yeah, I'm getting you the login for Shopify for.
Gavin McNamara: [19:06] Thank you.
Jack Espy: [19:07] Very nice.
Gavin McNamara: [19:09] Let's do a new image project and what we're going to do is job and.
Jack Espy: [19:51] And then maybe we can spend like, well, I guess two things. [19:56] Maybe put together what you're thinking. [20:00] We can just discuss like what you're thinking, like hourly going forward, like after these projects. [20:06] And then you and I can discuss like where. [20:09] What you're thinking for the shy project and then this project. [20:12] And then maybe we can spend the last like 15 minutes of today's call just going through the About Us page on spirit, on Strive just to try to get that finished. [20:21] So that way we can just upload that copy and it's done.
Gavin McNamara: [20:24] I love it. [20:28] Yeah, that sounds awesome. [20:31] Case.
Jack Espy: [20:33] Yeah. [20:35] Is it cold?
Gavin McNamara: [20:39] It was cold this morning. [20:42] Usually gets like, almost close to 70. [20:45] It's weird. [20:46] It's like. [20:46] It's like freezing in the morning and then like sweating midday and then cold again at night.
Jack Espy: [20:54] And it's almost November.
Gavin McNamara: [20:55] Yeah, dude. [20:58] Okay.
Jack Espy: [21:04] Austin sent you an invite for Shopify.
Gavin McNamara: [21:07] H***, yeah. [21:12] Let's see. [21:12] Where. [21:22] How's the traveling been?
Jack Espy: [21:24] Seriously, been good. [21:25] I'm in South Carolina right now at our place. [21:29] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [21:31] Dude, you're nuts. [21:32] Like, that is wild.
Jack Espy: [21:35] I know. [21:35] I've been on the go, so I'm down here until Monday. [21:38] I go to San Diego. [21:40] Monday, I'll be in San Diego. [21:42] Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I come back here to South Carolina. [21:46] I'm here for a couple of days, then I go to Austin, Texas, for a couple of days, then I go back to San Diego for about three or four days. [21:55] Then I go to Moab for my first ultra race, and then I go to Nashville for Thanksgiving, and then I'll be back in Florida for, like, a couple of weeks.
Gavin McNamara: [22:06] What about New York?
Jack Espy: [22:12] Oh, I don't think I'm gonna do New York long term, unfortunately. [22:15] I know, I know. [22:17] It's just like. [22:18] I don't know that that Mandami is.
Gavin McNamara: [22:21] Is, like, scary. [22:21] It's true.
Jack Espy: [22:23] Did you see him on the other night when he was debating?
Gavin McNamara: [22:29] No, I didn't.
Jack Espy: [22:30] Did. [22:30] He threw, like, a little temper tantrum. [22:32] Like, he didn't want to answer a question, and both the other guys answered it. [22:36] Like, Cuomo answered it very well, and he was like, well, I'm not answering that question. [22:40] Like, yeah, like, you can't pass on questions.
Gavin McNamara: [22:45] Answer your questions.
Jack Espy: [22:46] Yeah. [22:46] He looked like a little child. [22:47] It was ridiculous.
Gavin McNamara: [22:49] Yeah, dude. [22:50] Yeah, it's terrifying. [22:51] I hope. [22:51] I hope that, you know. [22:54] You know, I'm hoping that Cuomo pulls through, Honestly, if it's. [22:57] If it goes against him and Mandami, which is. [23:00] That's what it's obviously looking like. [23:03] Yeah. [23:05] Yeah. [23:05] Maybe I'll be looking for another place, but. [23:11] All right, so I got the image of the can and the case. [23:16] Yeah. [23:16] You want to take a rip at the top?
Jack Espy: [23:19] Okay, ready?
Gavin McNamara: [23:20] Three, two, one.
Jack Espy: [23:24] Make this into a render of the Spirited Hive vodka can in Spirited Hive vodka carton sitting at the base of a Christmas tree on Christmas morning. [23:38] Make it extremely festive. [23:41] This will be a product photo for a product page on the Spirited Hive website. [23:48] So make sure you can see it and make sure it's very clear in the image.
Gavin McNamara: [23:55] H***, yeah. [23:57] Come on, baby. [24:03] See, it's been nice.
Jack Espy: [24:07] Have you used Sora at all?
Gavin McNamara: [24:09] Oh, yeah.
Jack Espy: [24:11] Is Sora 2 out yet?
Gavin McNamara: [24:14] Yeah, it is.
Jack Espy: [24:16] Oh, dude. [24:18] Holy.
Gavin McNamara: [24:20] Dude. [24:21] Not bad. [24:26] Not bad. [24:27] Bad. [24:27] It does look a little wonky up here, but we can.
Jack Espy: [24:32] That's easy. [24:33] Zoom in. [24:34] Zoom in. [24:35] What the does that say?
Gavin McNamara: [24:36] Like, German? [24:45] What? [24:46] It's so what?
Jack Espy: [24:48] Why does that happen?
Gavin McNamara: [24:50] So that happens because it's so. [24:53] With the prompting, sometimes we gotta, like. [24:56] And this is something I've, like, learned recently is like, I have to be very specific with the, like, the. [25:06] The resolution. [25:08] I'm like, I need 8, like, 8K resolution on the cans spelling correctly. [25:14] And so what we're. [25:16] We're going to do is you can take this original prompt, you could paste it back in here, but then say with Nothing less than PK Image illusion quality 0 Ms. [25:47] Spelling the case. [26:03] Let's see if this works. [26:09] Oh. [26:11] Cancel meeting.
Jack Espy: [26:20] Oh. [26:21] Can you hear me?
Gavin McNamara: [26:22] Yes, sir.
Jack Espy: [26:23] Oh, my. [26:24] What? [26:25] Dude, I'm gonna freak out. [26:27] My WI fi in all these houses just doesn't work.
Gavin McNamara: [26:31] Dude, did you ever figure out what the problem was or.
Jack Espy: [26:35] No. [26:35] They came in and listen to this. [26:37] They're like, it's gonna cost 20k to redo all the WI fi. [26:44] So I think they paid it. [26:46] And the WI fi is even worse now.
Gavin McNamara: [26:52] Yo hate people like that, man.
Jack Espy: [26:56] I was like, $20,000. [26:58] I got my WI fi set up for maybe. [27:01] 200 bucks. [27:02] Yeah, very well.
Gavin McNamara: [27:05] And like what they, what those people try to do is like, they try to explain things that like, in a way that other people won't like, hopefully understand. [27:17] It's like, it's so complicated. [27:19] It's really. [27:21] It's not. [27:22] Well, it. [27:22] Well, it's, it's not easy, but it's not $20,000 either. [27:29] Yeah.
Jack Espy: [27:30] Yeah. [27:30] Freaking. [27:32] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [27:33] It's ridiculous. [27:34] And dude, like, if again, like, like, let's take a swing at just getting it work like, you know, working as. [27:40] As it needs to, like as a friend, you know. [27:44] Yeah, yeah. [27:45] Not like that's, that's like, sir, and I'm sorry I had to do that. [27:50] That's ridiculous.
Jack Espy: [27:52] No, I know. [27:52] I appreciate it. [27:53] When I'm back there, I'll just call you and maybe we could spend a little time. [27:57] Yeah, dude. [27:57] Figure it out. [27:59] Let's see.
Gavin McNamara: [28:04] Yeah, dude. [28:04] And, and, but like, yeah, I totally get the WI fi thing. [28:07] Like, it's a. [28:10] But you. [28:11] Like, the one good thing about your, like, from what I saw at least, like, it looks like you have like your own server rack, which is like pretty dope to have. [28:22] And like, like one of two things. [28:28] Like one, like the WI fi better be like, like five gigs, like, of like managing up to like a thousand computers at high. [28:39] That like high quality video, you know, Streaming. [28:46] Yeah. [28:46] I don't know, it just.
Jack Espy: [28:49] Well, they. [28:49] Guess what they originally wanted to charge, we're like 50, 70.
Gavin McNamara: [28:55] 70.
Jack Espy: [28:58] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [28:59] For. [29:00] What are they doing?
Jack Espy: [29:01] Are they like. [29:03] Does it come with a car?
Gavin McNamara: [29:04] Does this one. [29:05] Yeah. [29:06] Like, do they sit outside with like a satellite and like.
Jack Espy: [29:09] Yeah. [29:09] Do we do other midgets in the back, like running on treadmills to power each computer?
Gavin McNamara: [29:14] Like, how? [29:15] Seriously?
Jack Espy: [29:15] What?
Gavin McNamara: [29:16] I don't know.
Jack Espy: [29:16] I mean, I mean, George was like, no, we're not doing that.
Gavin McNamara: [29:20] Yeah. [29:21] And dude, like, you know, at the, at the same time, like WI fi is super important and like, you know, I know that like some infrastructure things could be, but like that's, that's, you know, like I, I'm. [29:38] I'm excited for us to try to take a swing at this and get it working like, better. [29:43] And you're like, yeah, we got this puppy working.
Jack Espy: [29:48] Hopefully it's back up and running because I'm in a different location, so hopefully it's back up and running at some point soon. [29:54] But yeah, if not, then you and I can hopefully put our whiz hats on or you can put your whiz hat on.
Gavin McNamara: [30:02] It's a Wii Project, my friend.
Jack Espy: [30:04] Yeah, it's.
Gavin McNamara: [30:06] It's always.
Jack Espy: [30:09] So this next one, should we try to do the. [30:11] The reindeer?
Gavin McNamara: [30:12] Let's try to do the reindeer.
Jack Espy: [30:15] I think the reindeer is pretty funny. [30:16] Where it's like Vixen has it. [30:20] He's like, yo, yo, Rudolph. [30:23] You try this yet? [30:25] Maybe not, but, like, try this.
Gavin McNamara: [30:30] This dank. [30:31] I don't know.
Jack Espy: [30:33] You tried this hive stuff yet? [30:37] You try this get good Rudolph.
Gavin McNamara: [30:39] That good. [30:40] Good. [30:44] I don't even know if that's how you spell reindeer. [30:46] It doesn't look like it.
Jack Espy: [30:53] Right in there.
Gavin McNamara: [30:56] What. [30:57] What version of Rudolph are we looking at? [30:59] Looking for?
Jack Espy: [31:00] I think the top one. [31:01] See the top middle, like, where he looks? [31:05] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [31:06] H***, yeah. [31:06] This was the best Rudolph back in the day, dude.
Jack Espy: [31:10] 100. [31:11] Let's see if it's.
Gavin McNamara: [31:12] I just want to save this one. [31:21] Let me just see. [31:22] Actually. [31:25] Perfect. [31:25] Okay, and then where the. [31:33] Okay, and then one more thing I want to grab is maybe a Rudolph and other brain and years. [31:51] Let's see. [32:00] Dude, Herbie. [32:02] So funny.
Jack Espy: [32:05] Which one do you.
Gavin McNamara: [32:07] Do you remember watching this?
Jack Espy: [32:08] This Rudolph. [32:09] Maybe we could do that. [32:10] Maybe we could do Rudolph and that guy.
Gavin McNamara: [32:12] Dude, this is Herbie. [32:13] He wants to be a dentist.
Jack Espy: [32:16] Maybe we do Herbie like, to Rudolph like. [32:19] Yo, you try this hive stuff yet?
Gavin McNamara: [32:21] Dude, That's a good. [32:22] That. [32:22] You know what? [32:23] That will resonate hard. [32:27] Herbie. [32:30] Rude. [32:34] Okay, let's do multi image. [32:41] We're gonna add is.
Jack Espy: [32:44] This is so cool. [32:45] I'm excited about this one.
Gavin McNamara: [32:47] Right? [32:47] It's so much fun. [32:50] All right, let me know when you're ready. [32:52] I'll let you take the reins.
Jack Espy: [32:54] Perfect. [32:55] All right, make an image of Herbie. [33:02] Holding the spirited Hive. [33:04] Vodka, cranberry and lime. [33:07] Make the can 8 pixels of resolution and have a little speech bubble above his head saying, yo, Rudolph, have you tried this Hive stuff yet, man? [33:23] Question mark? [33:28] Yeah, I don't know if that was good enough, but we'll see.
Gavin McNamara: [33:31] We'll find out. [33:33] That's the beauty of why not us?
Jack Espy: [33:37] That is the beauty of it.
Gavin McNamara: [33:39] You gotta take swings, baby.
Jack Espy: [33:41] So have you been grinding? [33:43] Like, has Graham done anything on the strive side or is it mainly just you?
Gavin McNamara: [33:46] Oh, it's been solely me, dude. [33:50] Oh, it's so close. [33:53] Oh, dude, we can make it.
Jack Espy: [33:59] So make it like, okay, why don't we do this? [34:02] Like, why can we say like, hey, like, redo the whole image but make it this. [34:08] Like, how do we, how do we make it so it looks like a claymation version of the Hive? [34:14] Yeah, okay. [34:15] Yeah, like, make it look real. [34:17] Like, make, make the Hive look like it's a part of the scene.
Gavin McNamara: [34:20] Exact. [34:21] Perfect. [34:22] All right, I'm going to let you take it away in 3, 2, 1.
Jack Espy: [34:27] Make it look like the Hive can is a part of the scene. [34:31] Like it fits in with their outfits and the vibe of this image. [34:37] And it doesn't have to be this exact image so you can move around the characters for it to fit the setting.
Gavin McNamara: [34:47] Perfect. [34:51] Let's see. [34:54] Yeah, so I've, it's, you know, with Graham, he is like on, like to be like fully honest and I think, I think I've told you this before, but like, Graham on paper isn't a part of why not us? [35:12] And so it's, it's just me, myself and my sexy eye. [35:18] But Graham's been a been like really like helpful with like building out the website and he does. [35:25] Oh, it's getting, I, I, I like where it's going with it, but it.
Jack Espy: [35:34] Yo, Rudol.
Gavin McNamara: [35:38] Rudol. [35:40] Oh my God. [35:43] I'm gonna try something much closer, but you gotta replace that can with a exact replica of the canon image 1. [35:55] So the shape, the size, and it's about the, the same dimensions as a 12 ounce range. [36:02] Red Bull and. [36:05] But make it fit the. [36:06] The scene so it looks like Herbie is naturally holding this. [36:13] This can. [36:15] And it looks. [36:18] It's. [36:18] It's with the. [36:20] The same exact, like, coloring the text and everything that Hive Cam looks like and says. [36:29] But it is specifically made for this scene. [36:41] I like how he's, like, Rudolph is almost taking a sip.
Jack Espy: [36:44] Yeah, I didn't even see that. [36:47] That's hilarious, right? [36:51] All right, so after this, will this spend the next. [36:54] Like, if it. [36:55] If this one comes out, it comes out, but if it doesn't, then we'll.
Gavin McNamara: [36:59] I'll be able to tweak it, no problem.
Jack Espy: [37:01] Did it just come back with this again?
Gavin McNamara: [37:03] It looks like it did.
Jack Espy: [37:07] Well, why don't we. [37:08] Because we only have 15 minutes. [37:09] Why don't we jump to the. [37:12] So you got what I'm kind of thinking here. [37:14] Like, red, like Christmas lights. [37:17] Like 100, like, trees. [37:21] Maybe like, Santa coming across somewhere.
Gavin McNamara: [37:23] Like, oh, we're going to make this page. [37:26] Like, so it's like, you're going to feel the holidays.
Jack Espy: [37:31] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [37:32] When you get here.
Jack Espy: [37:33] And honestly, I know I just said I hate music, but obviously, if it's not too expensive, maybe we could add, like, we could come up with, like, a little jingle.
Gavin McNamara: [37:43] I was. [37:43] You know what's so funny? [37:45] I was thinking the same exact thing. [37:49] I hate music on sites, but, like, a little, like, jingle in the background.
Jack Espy: [37:54] Yeah. [37:54] What if it was like. [37:55] Like a. [37:56] Like. [37:56] But like, we're singing it like Christmas from the hot family.
Gavin McNamara: [38:02] Dude, I love it.
Jack Espy: [38:05] Oh, that'd be hilarious.
Gavin McNamara: [38:07] And, dude, we can always try it and see if we like it and then take it out if we don't.
Jack Espy: [38:12] True, true. [38:14] Okay, cool. [38:15] So let's jump over to Strive. [38:17] Yep. [38:18] We'll go to the about us section.
Gavin McNamara: [38:21] Okay. [38:21] Strive. [38:24] Oh, this went to Shopify. [38:26] Strive soda. [38:28] Com.
Jack Espy: [38:34] We strive together. [38:36] Empowering every day at Strive. [38:39] We know recent accounts. [38:40] That's what we created. [38:47] Yeah, we need to update that copy.
Gavin McNamara: [38:50] All right, what are we thinking for tech?
Jack Espy: [38:57] What if we did this? [38:58] What if I spoke into it and I just kind of gave it, like, You know, like acid about, like the, like, kind of told like a brief intro of the founder story.
Gavin McNamara: [39:08] Yeah, perfect. [39:10] So then I won't paste this in, but yeah. [39:14] 3, 2, 1.
Jack Espy: [39:18] Update the copy on this page to be more founder focused but also empowering at the same time. [39:26] Tell the story about myself. [39:29] Jack Espy, the founder and CEO of Strive Soda. [39:33] He created this brand because he loves soda. [39:37] He loves great tasting beverages, but he also cares deeply about health and wellness and electrolytes and hydration. [39:45] He knows that most people walk around being dehydrated through most of their day, so he wanted to create a great tasting soda that also had electrolytes to keep you hydrated and feeling your best throughout the day, while also having amazing tasting soda. [40:03] He also cares deeply about organic ingredients, which is why he 100% sweetens thrive only with organic wildflower honey rather than utilizing synthetic sugars like sucralose, aspartame, etc. [40:19] He cares deeply about. [40:24] Yeah, maybe just stop it there. [40:26] I like it. [40:27] See what it comes out with.
Gavin McNamara: [40:29] Perfect. [40:33] Dude, my chat GBT is like. [40:35] It's like a gangster, like, got a gmac. [40:41] Got a gmac. [40:43] Gatsby.
Jack Espy: [40:46] Jack the Gap. [40:48] Jack Gatsby. [40:50] Jack Gatsby. [40:51] Yeah, there we go.
Gavin McNamara: [40:53] It's Jack sb, you dumb homie.
Jack Espy: [41:00] Did you say it like that?
Gavin McNamara: [41:02] Dude, I. [41:02] I have cursed out my chat GPT many times. [41:07] Yeah, Like, I. [41:08] I almost immediately feel bad after just because, like, there's like a piece of me that I'm like, I don't know what's gonna happen with this technology. [41:18] I don't want to.
Jack Espy: [41:19] Yeah, come back and freaking turn into your lamp in the middle of the night somehow and it stabs you.
Gavin McNamara: [41:24] Yo, Honestly, we're getting to that smart home era. [41:29] Very possible.
Jack Espy: [41:31] Dude, I don't think, like, yeah, don't even get me started on it. [41:34] I'm, like, freaked out about the whole thing. [41:36] All right, let's read this. [41:38] We strive together. [41:40] The founder story. [41:41] Strive Soda began with one simple truth. [41:43] Jack Espy loves soda. [41:45] Always has, but has loved, but also loves feeling good, staying hydrated, active, and balanced. [41:50] Somewhere along the way, he realized most people walk around dehydrated and reaching the for drinks that don't actually help. [41:58] So he decided to change that Jack spill shot to be more. [42:02] Beverage. [42:02] It's hydration for soda, crafted for people want incredible flavor and real function. [42:08] Each day is packed with. [42:09] Each can is packed with electrolytes to keep your body fueled and your mind sharp. [42:15] Instead of cutting corners with synthetic sugars like sucralose or aspartame, Jack chose 100% organic wildflower honey because nature already nailed sweetness. [42:24] It's his way of proving that health and flavor don't have to live in separate worlds. [42:29] Born in San Diego, California, Strive is made for you. [42:33] For those who move with purpose. [42:35] The athletes, the dream. [42:36] Oh, let's do the movers, the shakers, the doers there.
Gavin McNamara: [42:39] Nope.
Jack Espy: [42:43] And the everyday drivers chasing that. [42:46] What's next? [42:47] The movers, the shakers, and the everyday. [42:49] The movers, the shakers, the movers, the shakers, the doers, and the everyday strivers chasing what's next. [42:58] Oh, shakers and the everyday strivers are.
Gavin McNamara: [43:08] That is chasing what's next.
Jack Espy: [43:10] Yeah, Dude.
Gavin McNamara: [43:18] It's funny, when I start typing, I'm like, it's so, like, old fashioned. [43:23] Which is just a weird thing to think about and say out loud. [43:28] Replace. [43:29] Or is it? [43:31] Instead of the athletes, the dreamers, and the everyday drivers chasing what's next?
Jack Espy: [43:44] And then I think we should try one more pass at. [43:47] Pass at the mission statement.
Gavin McNamara: [43:49] 100%. [43:57] All right, so I'll let you go whenever you're ready.
Jack Espy: [44:01] Perfect. [44:03] If you could also update the mission. [44:05] Make it a little bit more punchy, get rid of energize. [44:08] We don't want to energize anywhere in this, but make it a little bit more punchy, make it a little bit more meaningful.
Gavin McNamara: [44:17] Perfect. [44:54] Do you want to do another iteration?
Jack Espy: [44:57] Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: [44:59] All right, let me know when you're ready.
Jack Espy: [45:02] Oh, I don't know what to tell it.
Gavin McNamara: [45:03] Oh, let's see.
Jack Espy: [45:05] Because I actually, I do. [45:06] What are your thoughts?
Gavin McNamara: [45:08] So like the mission, our mission. [45:12] I've. [45:14] I think it's good to have like the one liner and then, well, I guess like values is all. [45:27] Is something a little different. [45:29] But like the mission should be in my opinion, like an action. [45:32] It's like, you know, getting, you know, reducing hydra, like dehydration or you know, giving everyone the opportunity to get, you know, a good tasting soda at any local store near you. [45:55] Like where it's like, it's like a, it's a bold mission, but it is like a, like a good, like moonshot goal.
Jack Espy: [46:07] Yeah. [46:08] Well, I like that. [46:09] Maybe we throw that in there and then what we could do is if you want to copy and paste this and just put into an email to Chris and just say, hey, I worked with Jack on this this morning. [46:21] Let me know what your thoughts are and get his like, see, because then he can make any tweaks to it and then we can throw it on the site, you know, end of day.
Gavin McNamara: [46:28] Perfect. [46:29] Love it. [46:30] So just copy and paste this right here.
Jack Espy: [46:32] Well, I think what you added in, I think that could be great.
Gavin McNamara: [46:35] All right, perfect. [46:36] I'm just going to say can we also take a couple of shots at the our mission piece where it's more of like a moon shackle, you know, reducing dehydration or giving everyone the opportunity to have, you know, a healthy soda, you know, at hand where it feel like it tastes good as much as it, as it makes you feel good. [47:01] You know what I'm trying to say? [47:03] Take a couple of rips at that. [47:08] Let's see. [47:13] Bigger than us energy. [47:18] Yeah.
Jack Espy: [47:37] And I think the one tweak we need to make is like, like we always go back to soda hydration honey. [47:45] Not hydration soda honey. [47:48] So we need to make sure that soda is the main focus. [47:52] We are a better for you soda that aids in hydration, not a hydration soda, if that makes sense.
Gavin McNamara: [48:01] 100%. [48:25] Okay. [48:26] So it can be a shy. [48:28] We believe so. [48:28] It could taste incredible and do something good for you. [48:42] I actually kind of like option three.
Jack Espy: [48:44] Let me pull it up. [48:47] Option three to make soda a source of strength.
Gavin McNamara: [49:02] Proving soda can do better. [49:05] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jack Espy: [49:08] Let's copy that. [49:09] Okay. [49:10] But I just don't know if I like the beginning. [49:12] To make soda source of strength. [49:13] Yeah, that's too, like, hard out.
Gavin McNamara: [49:17] The option three is good, but that first line to make sort of a source of strength is. [49:23] Is too hard though. [49:25] Killian, come on. [49:27] You can do better. [49:28] But I do like everything else about option three, but give a couple of riffs of a non non hardo, but fits the fits exactly what strive soda is and what would go with the mission.
Jack Espy: [49:44] I love how you named him Gillian.
Gavin McNamara: [49:46] Yeah.
Jack Espy: [49:48] From like Killian Murphy. [49:50] Yeah, you legend.
Gavin McNamara: [49:52] I love Killian Murphy.
Jack Espy: [49:55] Brooklyn literally just texted me and she goes, I'm struggling with AI.
Gavin McNamara: [49:59] Yeah. [50:00] Yeah. [50:01] If she ever needs help, you know, more than happy to help Soda for the better. [50:12] To bring soda back to what is meant to be real refreshing and good for you. [50:18] To make soda actually makes you feel good.
Jack Espy: [50:24] To create soda that options I like 3c to make soda that actually makes you feel good because you deserve to taste. [50:46] You love. [50:52] That one's good.
Gavin McNamara: [50:55] Yeah. [50:56] We're building. [51:03] Option 3D is. [51:04] I like, the second line. [51:05] We believe refreshments should lift you up, not weigh you down. [51:15] But, like, really? [51:16] I think it's. [51:18] Yeah. [51:19] Is to, like, really emphasize on the hierarchy.
Jack Espy: [51:24] What if we did this? [51:25] Let's send over the original thing to Chris and be like, worked on this with Jack today. [51:32] The only thing we're working on is, like, how to perfect the mission statement.
Gavin McNamara: [51:36] Yep, perfect. [51:43] Love it, dude.
Jack Espy: [51:44] And, yeah, so I guess what Brooklyn's dealing with is she. [51:54] She bought this or she worked with this AI team that, like, allowed her to. [52:04] It was like, AI compatible with, like, Like, DMS and like that.
Gavin McNamara: [52:11] Okay.
Jack Espy: [52:13] And I guess it's just been causing her a lot of issue. [52:16] Like, if you followed her. [52:18] Yeah. [52:19] And, like, DM'd her, like, hey, like, I'm looking to lose some weight. [52:23] It would, like, immediately respond back and, like, be like, oh, here, like, I work. [52:27] I. [52:27] I help with that. [52:28] Like, please, you know, sign up here to, you know, book a call with me or something like that. [52:34] And I guess it's been giving her, like, a whole bunch of issues, dude.
Gavin McNamara: [52:38] I mean, yeah, I can, like, dude, there's so many janky AI solutions out there, and that. [52:47] That one is really common. [52:50] And I. [52:51] And there's some pretty, like, good solutions that can be done, you know, because, like, I guess, like, the outcome but should be looking for is, like, the book. [53:02] Like, a. [53:03] An appointment or book a.
Jack Espy: [53:05] Yeah, I think there's, like, more things that come with it. [53:07] I'm not really sure, but I know she's been dealing with this. [53:09] Like, she spent a lot of money on it, and I guess it's just not been hitting, like, it's been almost taking her more time to fix it than it would be to just independently reach out to these people.
Gavin McNamara: [53:20] Dude. [53:21] Yeah, that's. [53:22] That's not. [53:23] Okay. [53:24] A.I. [53:25] is supposed to take those things off your plate, not add more to your plate. [53:29] Yeah. [53:30] So, dude, absolutely. [53:31] If she. [53:32] If she wants to just, like, sync and. [53:34] And kind of go over some stuff, more than happy to.
Jack Espy: [53:37] Yeah. [53:37] That'd be amazing. [53:38] Yeah. [53:39] If you don't mind, I'll just. [53:39] I'll just put you guys in a group text.
Gavin McNamara: [53:42] I love it. [53:43] Absolutely. [53:44] Jack, I'm. [53:45] I'm your AI guy.
Jack Espy: [53:47] The AI wizard himself.
Gavin McNamara: [53:48] Yeah. [53:49] The Long Island.
Jack Espy: [53:50] Turns out. [53:52] Turns out Gavin's been a bot this whole entire time, actually talking to my digital clone. [53:57] Yeah. [53:58] I look outside and I'm like, what the is Gavin doing here?
Gavin McNamara: [54:04] Oh, all right, so I'll, I'll send this right now. [54:09] Jack and I works to. [54:12] To how about this together on drafting up the About Us page and wanted to send you over what we have so far. [54:23] One thing that we're still trying to, you know, perfect is the mission statement. [54:29] But please take a look at what we have so far and if you want to, if there's any tweaks you want to make, definitely let me know. [54:36] And then by end of day I can add this puppy into, you know, the About Us section for. [54:42] For Strive Soda.
