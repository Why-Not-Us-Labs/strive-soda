### [00:00 - 00:32] Opening & Context

**Gavin McNamara:** [00:02] Appreciate it. And again, apologies for the push out. You know, I know that everyone's packed and so I was, you know, it's not usually like me.

**Chris Clark:** [00:13] Hey, no worries. We're just excited to get things up and running. So I'll let you take it away, dive in wherever you want to start. And I think there'll probably be a follow up after this, so you don't have to cover everything in 20 minutes. But whatever, wherever you want to take us, I'm here for you.

**Gavin McNamara:** [00:32] Absolutely. So I mean, for my understanding of the meeting, just wanted to... What we could do is just kind of walk through the site and you can see my screen here.

**Chris Clark:** [00:41] Yep.

### [00:43 - 02:30] Homepage Walkthrough

**Gavin McNamara:** [00:43] Okay, cool. All right. So you know, as you can see from what the site was to now, definitely different, hopefully in a good way. But yeah, top fold. As you can see, you got "meet the soda remover shakers, doers" - that's what Jack has really been advertising, I would say. And so wanted to keep the site consistent with everything that Jack's talked about.

The beverage itself - I'm actually a big fan of the beverage and so, you know, I drink probably two of them a day. But going into the two pieces, right, there's the soda piece and then there's the hydration piece - and like what is a hydration soda? Right.

And so going into the different essentials that make up the hydration soda, you know, had added some images and some marketing, you know, when you hover over them to make it nice and fancy. We got the featured collection and then right here is the last thing I was working on. And so I still need to tidy this piece up.

But essentially one of the things that I wanted to make pretty cool - it was something that we saw that June Shine did that I think would be sexy in the site - was having this mobile phone move... I want to move this notification up. But now you have access to all of your social medias right from here. And so, yeah, and then we can tidy up the footer based off of any feedback. But yeah, just kind of going through the site. I know we're short in time, so just keep rolling.

### [02:30 - 03:43] Homepage Responsive Issue Identified

**Chris Clark:** [02:30] So real quick, real quick on the homepage. Love it. I'll definitely weigh in, get some feedback later. But one thing that's not loading on mine - I have a MacBook Pro, it's not the biggest screen - but on my homepage I'm pretty fully... Oh, I have to fully expand it like rail to rail on my computer to not cut off "meet the soda."

**Gavin McNamara:** [02:59] Really? Oh, I see. Okay, good.

**Chris Clark:** [03:03] I'm gonna take a screenshot when you're loading it, actually, the menu as well. So it goes home, shop, science, FAQ, and then "about us" is like this... I can share my screen if you want, but there's just a bit of a width thing going on right there.

**Gavin McNamara:** [03:20] I think I see it right now. I'm actually - I just minimized my screen a little bit, and so I see exactly what you're talking about, so... I'll prioritize that and get that done. Oh, yeah, it's just a responsive thing, so shouldn't be a hard fix, but yeah, it doesn't make it sexy. All right, good call out. Anything else on the homepage?

---

### [03:43 - 06:15] Content Hierarchy Discussion (CRITICAL)

**Chris Clark:** [03:43] No, I think it's night and day different than what we had before as far as education. And I love the "what is the hydration soda" section highlighting those three things. They're not necessarily the three brand pillars, but it definitely is the hydration education.

**The three brand pillars, like Jack has said from day one, is called hierarchy of information. Right. So top of hierarchy is: it's a soda. We want to be in the soda category. It's a soda occasion.**

**What qualifies as a better-for-you soda is the hydration element, which is very unique and very sexy. Everybody knows what hydration means on a fundamental level. And even more people every day are understanding what electrolytes mean. So they... That's the reason we put the two together. Right.**

**Electrolytes is getting more and more... There's more endurance sports athletes than there's ever been on planet Earth before. So people know electrolytes - marry the two together. And then I think the third one in the hierarchy would be the sweetening agent.**

**So every soda has to have some sweetness to boost the flavor. Ours comes from organic wildflower honey. That's our 1, 2, 3.**

**So when you're thinking about everything, hierarchy of information is: soda, hydration, sweetened comes from organic honey 100%.**

**Gavin McNamara:** [05:11] Okay, that makes sense. And so with these pieces here, do we think that we want to change them to match more of the hierarchy?

**Chris Clark:** [05:20] Well, if you miss the June Shine's page, they did that as well. So I forget the three exactly. But we did it on the Spirited Hive. So on our Spirited Hive website, we have "premium spirits is ready to enjoy" - so RTD is ready to drink, right? And he's ready to enjoy. So we adopted that for Spirited Hive.

So our first one is ready to enjoy. Number two is premium spirits - so we are spirits again, walking people through it as if they're fourth graders. Right? Ready to go cocktail. Premium spirits. And then sweetened with honey. That's our 1, 2, 3 for that brand.

**We have a 1, 2, 3 for Strive. And I love the hydration education, but I think if we're really backing it up to fourth graders, we're looking at: what is this thing? What is the thing?**

**Gavin McNamara:** [06:15] 100%. I completely agree with you there. Right. And so it's like, I'm looking at Spirited Hive right now, and I think, yeah, breaking it down to a fourth grader level. Right. Being able to... what you just said, we can add that to this section. And then if they want to learn more, then that can navigate them to more of the details. Right.

So this is more of the science page right behind the soda. And one of the big things too, and not to try to jump too fast, but just for the sake of time... we have literally the same things, and so we can switch these over too, so it matches the hierarchy a bit better.

---

### [06:58 - 09:31] Science Page Review

**Chris Clark:** [06:58] This is where it makes sense to have these three, because you're about hydration and you're talking about "75% of adults are chronically dehydrated." What's the cure? Right. Cured it. Got it. That's beautiful. I love this.

**Gavin McNamara:** [07:16] Awesome. And so then, yeah, going down, we got "what is the hydration soda?" So... yeah, I see now I'm going through it and just explaining it. I think that on the homepage, changing that one piece out to match more of the hierarchy and "what is this thing?" Right. Would be key. And then navigate on here, because right here we got "what is a hydration soda?" And then this is kind of goes into the more details behind it.

And one thing I'm looking at right now, too, is it does say "there's a new category of sparkling beverage designed to do more than just quench your thirst." Probably switch that up a little bit or call out the hierarchy itself a little bit better. All those are things that we can consistently make better. Right. And tweak the way that it's been built.

All right, continuing down. "Why, honey?" I don't like how it's the white background. So either gonna put Tiffany blue or this tannish color. Whatever you guys feel is good. Another thing too, with the "why honey?" - I don't know how you guys feel about the hover images. I do that because there's some SEO - the more images or more things that you have on the site, it's going to be easier for it to come up higher on the search page. And so being able to have a slick way to do that is through the hover graphics. But yeah. "Why, honey?" Anything about this section that feels to be sexier?

**Chris Clark:** [09:12] No, I think we can keep moving on. I'm gonna take a macro first, and then we'll go into the nitty gritty of what it says on every little block. But from the macro approach, I love how it goes into hydration, "why honey?" It has a good flow to it, so I think we're on point.

---

### [09:31 - 11:55] Shop Page & Product Collections

**Gavin McNamara:** [09:31] Perfect. All right. And then, yep, it flows into the next piece where "not all sweeteners are created equal." Could be a little bit sexier, I think, in regards to the way that's presented, but the foundations here. Right. And then going into the bottom...

**Chris Clark:** [09:53] I love the CTA there.

**Gavin McNamara:** [09:56] Do I need to remove one of them, though? It just kind of looks a little funky with both of them. So, yeah, I can remove that one. And then we have the CTA right here. And then if we go to "shop all flavors"...

[Navigation to shop page]

Okay, so we got the "shop all flavors" here. Same layout - all these images I generated using the awesome material and the information that you guys already had. And going into "choose your vibe." And then you also have the hover over the sodas "built for those who strive." Tried to get fancy with it a little bit here with having a background of people doing yoga, hiking, things like that. Not sure that matters too much, but those are the details I was kind of going into and then continuing.

"When did drinks drive?" Right? I think Jack nailed it when he was like, you know, "before yoga, after a run, midday refresh on the trail" - just kind of giving a broad spectrum. Really, for me, midday refresh is like, that's it. You know, as much as I want to be doing yoga and running, midday refresh gets me.

So then we have "want to learn more about hydration soda" - this brings you back here. But we could have that CTA be the same so it's consistent all the pages. So it goes to "shop flavors" or brings them to a particular soda. So all those things we can tweak.

---

### [11:55 - 13:25] FAQ Page Review

**Gavin McNamara:** [11:55] All right, let's keep going. The FAQ - it's a little plain Jane right now, but goes into the details of "what is Strive soda?" "What flavors do you offer?" "Why do you use honey instead of sugar?" "What electrolytes are in Strive?" And maybe this needs to be a different CTA because obviously these are not... Well I don't actually, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe these are electrolytes or what make up the electrolyte.

"When should I drink Strive?" "Order shipping," "More product information" - so this was lower on the priority list for getting everything done. But I wanted to make sure that we actually had a structure for the page and so this is where we're at with it.

**Chris Clark:** [12:48] I love the accordion and the way you have it. Yeah, I agree it's a little plain Jane, but we can... We got the content first and then we can make it sexy later.

**Gavin McNamara:** [13:01] 100%.

**Chris Clark:** [13:03] **I think this FAQ could probably go to footer if we think science is strong enough. I think FAQ could go to footer just to keep the header simple and focus on purchase... Yeah, maybe we could put a link in science somewhere too.**

**Gavin McNamara:** [13:25] Agreed. Yeah those are both easy adjustments and I do agree now that I'm looking at it - the goal is for them to purchase Strive at the end of the day, get enough information. FAQ is more of a fallback.

---

### [13:39 - 15:31] About Us Page Review

**Gavin McNamara:** [13:39] Then "about us" - I don't know how Jack likes this photo. I use this one to start out but this is the foundation of the page of "about us." Right. So "we strive together," "empower your everyday." Maybe these are too much fluff words but anything we want we can add and adjust.

One thing I did different here just because I was trying to figure out what the right design - and I really like the idea of the Tiffany blue and the orange - but I didn't know if the checkered board layout would be ideal. And so I ended up trying it here and trying to get a little creative. Jack said try to be creative on this page and this is my shot at it.

Obviously I would add another image here or we can add some type of animation where you can kind of go down through a story and do less scrolling. But then "our mission" - maybe our mission moves up. But all these pieces, the way that I built it, are components where now I can easily move any of these things around to any part of the site. And so that's the win here in regards to this.

If we wanted to take this piece and say, all right, we're going to add text, we want images, animation, whatever we want - it's built in a way that can be pushed at any point anywhere on the site. Obviously still blank. Needs more love. Then yeah, the "shop all flavors." Okay, this goes to the right flavors.

### [15:39 - 18:05] Product Page Features

**Gavin McNamara:** [15:39] And then I know you got two minutes. So then going into the actual product page. So a couple of things. I updated the "subscribe and save" to be the thing that's automatically selected and changed it from 20% to 15% based off of what Jack requested.

Didn't add any new images in here. I wanted to leave that until we had another conversation on what you guys would like to put in here. But yeah, the one stop shop - you can add to cart, but you can also just buy with Shop Pay. And naturally, landing on "subscribe and save" - I think that's where the money maker is. But that's just my perspective.

But then it goes into "what's in Strive?" I talked with Austin. He said that having something with the Nutrition Facts label has always been big. And so I built this out specifically based on that request. And trying to kind of still follow the same font - coloring can be adjusted. But then "why choose Strive?" - the same thing that we saw on the other page just added here.

"Strive vs Everyone" - this is another section that was brought up with Austin. And these were all things that were like, all right, do we want to keep this infinite scroll vibe or do we want to move some of these things to other pages or just hide them for now. And so any of those could be - any of the above can be done for now with a click.

And then I added back in the images from prior to me jumping in. And so I would say right, at this point, I am somewhat of a perfectionist and that could be good and bad - these things that I easily see. But also having your perspective and what you're looking for is what's gonna assist me with being able to make the site better than June Shine, better than anything. And that's the goal.

### [18:05 - 21:51] Feedback & Future Collaboration (CRITICAL)

**Chris Clark:** [18:05] **Yeah. Well, I think it's a 180 degrees better than what it was before. So I can't thank you enough and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you if that's an option.**

**Gavin McNamara:** [18:19] Absolutely.

**Chris Clark:** [18:20] **It's been like the last 30 seconds just talking about where to go next. These are great bones. I think a lot of the macro things are there. We could iterate and perfect and design until the cows come home and I would love to continue doing that with you.**

**So yeah, if maybe we could follow up with what it looks like to continue working together. I know I would like that. It sounds like Jack and you work great together. I think he'll probably hand it off to me pretty soon to just do a lot of more of the design and maybe working some copy and some messaging and look and feel from a product page standpoint that it has to transact.**

**So there's just fundamentals there that are going to be great to keep building upon. And I love how you describe it first - that's absolutely the way it should work. And people can click whatever they want after that. But I think you think that way about it from a sales standpoint - the website needs to...**

**Very few people now... I don't really go to websites that much. I see Instagram content, I buy what I like and I figure out... usually I'm also... I go to the store thing honestly, so...**

**But there is this thing called direct to consumer and e-commerce and there's rules of how to make that work. And we're trying to beef up our digital presence. So we'll protecting our funnel to get people to the site and when they come to the site, the page needs to transact and they need to add to cart and then check out that stuff.**

**So I think you can get there super easy. What you do have coming is some really rad content. So photography that June Shine has - that's the level that we're now shooting for in studio. We did a shoot last week. I should have photos for you next week from the studio. We're gonna go back and do another full day of studio shoots.**

**So beautiful. I'd love to just get you those images. But you know, June Shine is also using a lot of real studio photography and that's where it's at. The AI is good, but it's...**

**Gavin McNamara:** [20:48] It's considered a placeholder right?

**Chris Clark:** [20:51] **100%. I'm glad you can get those placeholders because it really helps. It's so hard to build a website without any imagery. So the fact that you can get it halfway there and I can get you the other half - we can replace stuff over time and really excited about that.**

**So you should have that early next week. What I'd love to do is get those photography albums, let you go crazy with it, and then also give me feedback on what's missing. Right. So when we do another day in the studio, we can shoot for web in a more sophisticated way.**

**So especially for design - really interesting and sexy photos of the science behind Strive or electrolytes or salt or elements - and really get you some visuals that you're just like... when you think about making a site better than June Shine, 100% doable. But that's where the creativity comes in and that's where I can help out. So thank you. Thank you.**

### [21:51 - 23:28] Contract Discussion (RETAINER MODEL CONFIRMED)

**Gavin McNamara:** [21:51] Thank you so much.

**Chris Clark:** [21:52] You crushed it. I really... I'd love to keep working with you.

**Gavin McNamara:** [21:57] Yeah, absolutely. I haven't talked to Jack about what that looks like and I don't want to hold you up and we can talk about this after. But is there a level of... how much you guys want to work together or is it more of... I guess I'm asking a weird question, but like coming on full time or is it more of like working together contracts and...

**Chris Clark:** [22:23] **Yeah, we would do a contract either like a maintenance retainer and then we could do project sprints. Right. So, like, hey, we need a new landing page that has these cool features.**

**We also have two brands as you know, so there's a lot of work to be done. Yeah, there's no lack of work, but it's just... let's figure it out as far as maintenance retainer goes - just to keep... for all this little stuff, you're going to be going in there and being like, hey, this isn't working, we need to update this. And I just... I'm on the roster as a third party, constantly listening to you guys getting feedback and iterating.**

**There's a budget for that. And then there's also like, hey, we need this new thing. Gavin, help us. Yeah, dude, I already know the infrastructure. I have my password. I'm good to go.**

**Gavin McNamara:** [23:13] Yeah, I love it. That's perfect. Yeah, man. Excited to chat. Yeah, I'll definitely... I'll put some stuff together and yeah, let's... I'm gonna make some of those updates too on the site. But yeah, I'm gonna... I would love to continue to work with you guys. You guys are like, freaking awesome.

### [23:31 - 24:00] Closing & Additional Opportunities

**Chris Clark:** [23:31] So sweet, dude. Well, thanks for jumping on. And I just sent you my cell phone number. Yeah, **and then Jack also mentioned that you could possibly do some other graphic stuff for us. So to chat about a couple ad hoc things that we have coming through, maybe you can mock something up for us.**

**Gavin McNamara:** [23:51] 100%, man. I'm your guy.

**Chris Clark:** [23:54] Sweet brother. Well, good to meet you.

**Gavin McNamara:** [23:56] Thanks for your time. Absolutely. You as well, man.

**Chris Clark:** [23:59] Talk soon.

**Gavin McNamara:** [24:00] All right, bye.
