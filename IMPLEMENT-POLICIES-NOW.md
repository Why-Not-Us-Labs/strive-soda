2. **Company address** - Add physical address if required by state law
3. **Shipping times** - Update with actual fulfillment times
4. **Return window** - Adjust 30-day window if needed
5. **Subscription terms** - Verify pricing and cancellation terms

### Legal Review

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** While these policies are comprehensive and based on standard templates, I recommend having them reviewed by a legal professional to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and your specific business practices.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the pages to delete"

- They might already be deleted
- Or named slightly differently
- Search for "science" in pages - if policy pages show up in results, delete them

### "Links still go to science page"

- Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
- Try in incognito/private window
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Shopify cache to clear

### "Policies aren't showing up"

- Make sure you saved each policy in Settings > Policies
- Verify menu links point to `/policies/*` (not `/pages/*`)
- Check that old pages were deleted

### "Need help with customization"

- Email me or message with specific questions
- I can help adjust any policy language
- Can add missing sections or clauses
